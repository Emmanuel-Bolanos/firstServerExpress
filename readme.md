# Notes Express Server

This is an example of a simple RESTful API made with express.

The demo uses Express with an RDS instance with mysql to CRUD notes.

The server is deployed with CodeDeploy and served with nginx acting as a reverse proxy.

The SSL certificate was obtained thanks to [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)  !
